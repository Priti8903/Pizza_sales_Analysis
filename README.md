 üçï Pizza Sales Analysis ‚Äì SQL Project

 üìå Project Overview

Welcome! I'm Priti Tiadi, and this project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze real-world business data ‚Äî in this case, pizza sales from a fictional Pizza Hut dataset.

 The analysis was performed using "SQL queries" on multiple related tables including:
 
``` sql
select * from customers
```

- "pizzas"
- "pizza_types"
- "orders"
- "order_details"

This project provides insights that can help boost sales, improve customer experience, and drive business growth.
